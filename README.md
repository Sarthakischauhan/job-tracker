# job-tracker
Aimed to be a one-in ecosystem for tracking my job applications. From adding my application to helping me keep a track of what jobs I have applied to.

**Some ambitious features to look for**
- Tracking what resume was given to a particular job
- What were my chances at that time.
- Autofill for applications

> **_NOTE:_**  While this is primarily for myself, I would try my best to cook something that can be used by everyone!
